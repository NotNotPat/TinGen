# TinGen
Script that will allow you to easily generate an index file (with encryption if needed) for use with Tinfoil.
This project is a based on [this project](https://github.com/BigBrainAFK/tinfoil_gdrive_generator/) by [BigBrainAFK](https://github.com/BigBrainAFK/).  
  
**NOTE: The token generated by this script can also be used with Tinfoil.**
**NOTE2: Encrypted index will only work if SX License is available. Unencrypted index will still work with any CFW.**

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Modules from `requirements.txt` found in the root of project directory.
- `credentials.json` (or any file name if using `--credentials` flag to pass custom location for the required credential file). It can be obtained from [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python) by clicking the `Enable Drive API` button in there while being signed in with the user account you want to generate credentials for or from Google's Developer Console.
- Google Drive Folder IDs to scan and index.

Execute the following command in a terminal to install all the required modules.  
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
